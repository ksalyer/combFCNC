*** Instructions for running combine commands ***

Workspaces are produced from datacards with e.g.

text2workspace.py path_to_datacard.txt -o Datacard.root -P HiggsAnalysis.CombinedLimit.PhysicsModel:multiSignalModel -m 125.380000 higgsMassRange=122,128 --PO "map=.*/fcnc.*:r_fcnc_hct[0,-2,2]"  --PO "map=.*/tth.*:1"  --PO "map=.*/ggh.*:1"  --PO "map=.*/wh.*:1"  --PO "map=.*/zh.*:1"  --PO "map=.*/thq.*:1"  --PO "map=.*/thw.*:1"  --PO "map=.*/vbf.*:1"

And fits are performed with e.g.

combine -M AsymptoticLimits -m 125.380000 --run blind Datacard.root -n limit > output.txt

[SetFlag] Changing value of flag "check-negative-bins-on-import" from 1 to 0
[SetFlag] Changing value of flag "workspaces-use-clone" from 0 to 1
Not a shape-based datacard / shape-based datacard using RooDataHist. Skipping checks on systematic shapes.

=======Validation results=======
================================
>>>There were no warnings of type  'up/down templates vary the yield in the same direction'
>>>There were no warnings of type  'up/down templates are identical'
>>>There were no warnings of type  'At least one of the up/down systematic uncertainty templates is empty'
>>>There were  413 warnings of type  'Uncertainty has normalisation effect of more than 10.0%'
>>>There were no warnings of type  'Uncertainty probably has no genuine shape effect'
>>>There were no warnings of type 'Empty process'
>>>There were no warnings of type 'Bins of the template empty in background'
